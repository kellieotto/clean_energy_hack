We believe in the power of women to fight climate change. 

Corporations with more women on their board have better climate and environmental performance. However, among the Russell 3000, only 28 percent of boards have at least one-fifth of their respective seats held by womenâ€”and only 1.7 percent have at least two-fifths held by women. At Evvaru, we raise awareness of corporate gender disparities and mobilize campaigns to add more women to boards and fight climate change.
